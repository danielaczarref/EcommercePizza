# E-Commerce Pizza for Mobile Applications 

## Authors: Andr√© Luiz, Daniela Carvalho

This project was developed for a Computer Engineering's subject, Mobile Applications Development, in order to practice and to study Dart programming language for future Flutter development.

This microproject simulates a pizza online shopping in which our customer can choose to order pizza from 4 different flavors, 2 kinds of soda and other additionals such as beer, drinks and french fries. 

Unfortunately, we still haven't implemented a database for this project. By all means, this is our first attempt to programming in Dart language so let's take one step at a time!

### Main user inputs
  Our customer can choose to:
  ```
  1 - Add items to their request;
  2 - Review their order;
  3 - End request.
  ```
  
### Pizza 
  Our customer can choose four different flavors of pizza:
  ```
    1. Pepperoni, G sized pizza, for $ 59.9
    2. 4 Cheese, M sized pizza, for $49.89
    3. Chicken with catupiry (famous brazilian flavor), G sized pizza, for $69.9
    4. Jerked beef, G sized pizza, for $69.9
   ```
   
### Soda
  Our customer can choose only two different kinds of soda available in our e-commerce:

    1. Coke, 1L, for $10
    2. Pepsi, 1.5L, for $9
